# Iteration means executing the same block of code over and over, potentially many times. A programming structure that implements iteration is called a loop.

# In programming, there are two types of iteration, indefinite and definite:

# With indefinite iteration, the number of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance. Rather, the designated block is executed repeatedly as long as some condition is met. Use while for this iteration.

# With definite iteration, the number of times the designated block will be executed is specified explicitly at the time the loop starts. Use 'for' for this iteration.
